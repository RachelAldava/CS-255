•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
In the course scenario. A startup company was contracting our development firm to develop a website to facilitate drivers education services; they wanted a system which could facilitate practice tests and schedule appointments.

•	What did you do particularly well?
I believe I was able to design a system which met the client’s precise vision of the system they envisioned and was able to suppress my own ideas for how the system ought to function. A few design choices seemed rather silly.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If this were a real-world scenario, I would hope to have more opportunities to communicate with the client and help refine their ideas about how the system ought to have function.
If I were to want to re-submit my work, I think I would have spent a bit more time on the short paper of project 1. My short paper wasn’t so short. I wanted to fully address the ideas at play, but in the moment I had trouble distilling these ideas to a more reasonable length.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
We were operating off a brief transcript of an interview. From the questions the client answered in the interview we could gather a clear understanding of the minimum functionality of the system. Near the end of the transcript, the client expressed an interest in expanding the system’s capabilities at a later point. Because of this opportunity for further improvements, and because the client may have limited monetary flow due to being a startup, I chose to design the system to meet these requirements and very little further. For example, the client wanted customers to be able to take practice tests, so I designed a test proctoring system which was barebones. If I were to add additional features and ignore the client’s wishes to limit the scope of the project, it could impact the time the project takes and the money that would be required.

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I don’t believe I have designed enough software to establish an approach. I would hope that my priorities would be a product which accurately fulfills the specifications needed. One thing I ought to improve on is being diligent about planning how each component of the system will interact with each other before I design how the individual components will function. In my earlier programming course I jumped straight into projects without planning things out first and usually had to re-write major sections of the code. Since then, I have gotten better, but I still need to be cautious.
